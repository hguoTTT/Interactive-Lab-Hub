# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

Hansen is reading a book in his room right now. However, he doesn't have the correct reading postures and has his face way too closely to the book. Because of that, he eyesight is slowly deteriorating and he has to wear a pair glasses when he goes around. 

Thankfully, the reading posture corrector is here to help correct Hansen's posture while reading, and help him prevent his eyesight from worsening. While on, if the reader is having a correct reading posture, the posture corrector will just be a normal reading lamp. However, if the user posture changes, and creeps closer the book, the posture corrector will start flashing yellow light to warn the reader to fix the position. And if the reading is ignored or if the reader creeps even closer, a more rampant red light will be flashed instead.

The user is able to turn the reading posture corrector on and off by pressing the on/off button.

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Acting out the interaction, I used a normal lamp and turn it on and off to simulate the process of the light flashing. It turns out that it is fairly noticable. It turns out through the interaction that normal light flashing is already fairly noticable, and it should be even more noticable when the color of the light also changes.


## Part C. Prototype the device

One problem about using tinkerbell and the smartphone is that the smartphone doesn't emit a strong enough like, therefore it is a bit difficult to see the change in colors if you are focusing on another task and not on the phone. Another thing about tinkerbell is that it is a bit difficult to emulate flashing lights, and you would have to manually switch between different colors which can be a bit tedious and difficult.


## Part D. Wizard the device
A demo with paper prototype is as follows:

## Part E. Costume the device

One thing that was considered during the design process is that when the user is reading with the correct posture, the posture corrector serves as a normal desk lamp. Because of that, the shape of the corrector is designed specifically to resemble a lamp.


## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

One feedback that I received is that I can talk more about the sensors for the posture corrector. Another feedback I received is that there might be privacy issues, but wasn't made clear how it might be so.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
